## About me
My complete name is Michael Gabriel Farias Segura, a name that belongs in a spanish soap opera, I know. I'm originally from San Diego, California. My family is of Mexican descent. Origins that I'm proud of. I love our culture, our food, and our ability to befriend anyone. I spent many years in Mexico as I grew up and I really enjoyed my stay there. But, there is no place like home and I eventually returned to San Diego.
## My hobbies  
* Hiking
* Films
* Traveling (in the future)  
Nature is awesome. I really enjoy hiking. I believe enjoying the simple things in life is the key to happiness. There is nothing like watching a beautiful sunset after a long day. Also, I love watching films. I love movies from all types of genres as long as they have a captivating plot. There is something fascinating with being able to empathize with a main character as he or she defies unfavorable circumstances. In the future, I would love to pick up traveling as my new hobby. I have traveled to many places in Mexico but there is so much more I would like to see from other countries.  
During my travels in Mexico, I stumbled into a beautiful lake called Camecuaro in Michoacan. Below is a picture of me and the lake.
